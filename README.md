# Outlook_mail_sorter
This is a macro that helps sort mails in outlook.

## Manual sorting
After selecting multiple items, the macro will ask you for a folder you've defined in your abbreviations list. If you don't select one, you will get a folder explorer to select your desired target folder.

## Automated sorting
Using these subroutines you will be able to sort mails based on the conversation they are in. The e-mail will be placed in the same folder as the initial e-mail of the conversation.

## How to install
* put thisoutlooksession code in thisoutlooksession object
* import mail_sorter.bas module
* define some abbreviations in this module
* link the subroutines that start with "start....." to your quick ribbon for easy access
